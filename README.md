# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a widespread issue driven by evolving cyber threats like identity theft and phishing. This project aims to identify fraud through advanced algorithms and machine learning, enhancing security measures for real-time detection and proactive prevention.

# DataSet
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

# Stats 
The data set contained a total of Valid:284315 and Fraud:492. This features in this data set included Time,	V1-V28,	Amount, and	Class.

# Model 
RandomForestClassifier was used to determin anomalies in the data and classify fraud vs normal creditcard transactions. The Model was trained on 70% of the training set. No specifc sampling was needed for this model. 

# Results
The model was tested on 30 % of the data and yeilded:
Precision: 0.9556
Accuracy: 0.9995
Recall: 0.7818
F1 Score: 0.8600
